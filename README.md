# Procedure Coverage Intelligence Engine
## Executive Summary

This project will build a **CPT/HCPCS Procedure Intelligence POC** using publicly available CMS synthetic Medicare claims, CMS HCPCS data, ICD-10 data, Medicare coverage policies, and licensed AMA CPT data where available. The goal is to demonstrate how healthcare claims data, analytics, machine learning, and LLMs can be combined into a practical tool for investigating procedures, providers, utilization patterns, and coverage requirements.

The application will be built entirely in **Python and Streamlit**, using **Pandas, Parquet, DuckDB, scikit-learn, and Plotly**, with no cloud database or Snowflake dependency. The pipeline will transform raw CMS files into a reusable local analytical dataset and derived feature tables.

The primary user experience will be an **“Investigate a Procedure”** workflow. A user will select a CPT/HCPCS code and optionally provide a diagnosis, provider, date range, or place of service. The application will return:

* Procedure description and utilization profile
* Common diagnoses associated with the procedure
* Provider and peer-group utilization patterns
* Place-of-service and geographic patterns
* Relevant Medicare NCDs, LCDs, and Articles
* Statistical anomaly signals
* Supporting evidence and data provenance
* An LLM-generated explanation grounded in the underlying evidence

The project will intentionally separate **observed claims data, statistical analysis, policy evidence, and AI-generated interpretation**. Machine learning will initially focus on identifying unusual utilization patterns rather than predicting denials, because the synthetic claims data do not provide reliable real-world denial labels. The LLM will function as an explanation and investigation assistant rather than as the decision-maker.

The resulting POC will demonstrate a broader **healthcare procedure intelligence architecture** that could eventually evolve into denial prevention, prior-authorization intelligence, coding anomaly detection, coverage intelligence, and provider investigation capabilities.

**Core outcome:** a deployable Streamlit application that demonstrates how fragmented CPT/HCPCS, claims, clinical, provider, coverage-policy, analytics, and AI information can be connected into a single procedure intelligence layer.

# CPT/HCPCS Procedure Intelligence POC

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name

**CPT/HCPCS Procedure Intelligence**

### Objective

Build a personal portfolio proof-of-concept that combines:

* CMS synthetic Medicare claims
* AMA CPT reference data, where licensing permits
* CMS HCPCS reference data
* ICD-10 diagnosis data
* CMS Medicare Coverage Database (MCD) data
* Python/pandas
* Parquet
* DuckDB
* scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* LLM-based evidence summarization

The application will allow a user to select a CPT/HCPCS procedure and investigate:

1. What the procedure is
2. How it is being used
3. Which diagnoses are associated with it
4. Which providers/specialties use it
5. Where it is performed
6. How utilization varies across providers
7. Whether utilization appears unusual
8. Whether Medicare coverage policies are associated with the procedure
9. What evidence explains an identified anomaly

The initial application will **not claim to predict actual claim denials**, because the CMS synthetic claims do not provide the health-plan denial outcomes needed to train and validate a true denial prediction model.

Instead, the initial product will focus on:

> **Procedure and Claim Risk Intelligence**

A future version can incorporate a real labeled denial dataset and evolve toward denial-risk prediction.

---

# 2. Product Concept

## Core User Question

> **"What should I know about this procedure before I investigate a claim, provider, or utilization pattern?"**

The application should move beyond a traditional CPT lookup.

Instead of:

```text
CPT → Description
```

the application should provide:

```text
CPT/HCPCS
    ↓
Clinical context
    ↓
Utilization
    ↓
Provider behavior
    ↓
Peer comparison
    ↓
Coverage policy
    ↓
Anomaly detection
    ↓
Evidence-based explanation
```

---

# 3. Target User

The initial target user is an:

* Healthcare data analyst
* Health-plan analyst
* Product manager
* Utilization-management analyst
* Provider analytics analyst
* Revenue-cycle analyst

The application should assume that the user understands claims at a basic level but does not want to manually investigate multiple CMS sources.

---

# 4. Technology Architecture

The POC will be developed entirely on a personal computer.

No Snowflake or other cloud data warehouse is required.

# 5. Data Sources

## 5.1 CMS Synthetic Medicare Claims

Primary CMS collection:

https://data.cms.gov/collection/synthetic-medicare-enrollment-fee-for-service-claims-and-prescription-drug-event

### Initial files

Download:

* `carrier.csv`
* `outpatient.csv`
* `inpatient.csv`
* `beneficiary_2019.csv`
* `beneficiary_2020.csv`
* `beneficiary_2021.csv`
* `beneficiary_2022.csv`
* `beneficiary_2023.csv`

### Defer initially

* DME
* HHA
* Hospice
* SNF
* PDE

These can be added in later releases.

---

# 6. Claims Data Model

The raw CMS files should not be modified.

Use three layers:

```text
data/
├── raw/
├── processed/
└── derived/
```

## Raw

Store original CMS downloads.

```text
data/raw/
├── carrier/
├── outpatient/
├── inpatient/
├── beneficiary/
├── hcpcs/
└── coverage/
```

Raw data should remain unchanged so the ETL process is reproducible.

---

# 7. Processed Data

Convert large CSV files to Parquet.

Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/raw/carrier.csv")

df.to_parquet(
    "data/processed/carrier.parquet",
    index=False
)
```

Parquet becomes the application's primary local data format.

---

# 8. Canonical Claims DataFrame

Create a standardized claims structure regardless of the original CMS file.

## `claims_df`

Required fields:

```text
claim_line_id
claim_id
bene_id
service_date
claim_type
procedure_code
code_system
modifier_1
modifier_2
place_of_service
provider_id
diagnosis_1
diagnosis_2
diagnosis_3
diagnosis_4
revenue_code
units
charge_amount
allowed_amount
paid_amount
admit_date
discharge_date
data_source
```

CMS-specific source columns should be retained in the raw layer.

---

# 9. Beneficiary DataFrame

## `beneficiary_df`

Canonical structure:

```text
bene_id
year
age
sex
race
state
county
medicare_entitlement
esrd_flag
heart_failure_flag
ckd_flag
copd_flag
diabetes_flag
cancer_flag
stroke_flag
```

This provides patient context and allows longitudinal analysis.

---

# 10. Procedure Reference Data

## CMS HCPCS

Official CMS source:

https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/healthcare-common-procedure-system/quarterly-update

Use the current HCPCS Level II file.

Create:

## `procedure_df`

```text
procedure_code
code_system
description
category
subcategory
effective_date
termination_date
source
```

For example:

```text
procedure_code | code_system | description
------------------------------------------------
Jxxxx         | HCPCS       | ...
Gxxxx         | HCPCS       | ...
```

---

# 11. AMA CPT

Use the organization's appropriately licensed AMA CPT data if available.

Do not scrape CPT descriptions for a production or commercial application.

Create:

```text
procedure_code
code_system
description
category
subcategory
effective_date
termination_date
source
```

Combine CPT and HCPCS into a unified procedure reference table.

---

# 12. ICD-10

Use a current public CMS/CDC ICD-10-CM reference source.

Create:

## `icd10_df`

```text
icd10_code
description
chapter
category
subcategory
effective_date
termination_date
```

This allows analysis of:

```text
Procedure
    ↕
Diagnosis
```

rather than treating CPT/HCPCS as isolated codes.

---

# 13. CMS Medicare Coverage Database

Official CMS source:

https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/downloads/downloads.aspx

Download initially:

* Current LCD data
* Current Article data
* NCD data

Do not initially load the complete historical policy corpus.

---

# 14. Coverage Data Model

## `lcd_df`

```text
lcd_id
title
contractor
jurisdiction
effective_date
retirement_date
status
document_text
```

## `article_df`

```text
article_id
title
effective_date
retirement_date
status
document_text
```

## `article_code_df`

```text
article_id
procedure_code
code_system
icd10_code
modifier
bill_type
revenue_code
coverage_status
```

## `ncd_df`

```text
ncd_id
title
effective_date
termination_date
status
document_text
```

## `ncd_code_df`

```text
ncd_id
procedure_code
code_system
icd10_code
coverage_relationship
```

---

# 15. CMS Coverage API

Use the CMS Coverage API where practical:

https://api.coverage.cms.gov/docs/swagger/index.html

The API can supplement the downloaded MCD files.

Potential workflow:

```text
Procedure selected
       ↓
Coverage API
       ↓
Relevant NCD/LCD/Article
       ↓
Retrieve evidence
       ↓
Display source
       ↓
Optional LLM explanation
```

The API should not be the sole source of truth.

Downloaded CMS data should remain available for reproducibility.

# 17. Data Pipeline

## Step 1 — Download

Download CMS source files manually initially.

Record:

* Source URL
* Download date
* File name
* CMS release date
* Number of rows
* File size

Maintain:

```text
data/source_manifest.csv
```

Example:

```text
source
file
download_date
release_date
row_count
```

---

# 18. Step 2 — Raw Data Validation

For every file:

Check:

* File exists
* Expected columns exist
* Row count
* Null percentages
* Duplicate records
* Date ranges
* Code formatting
* Numeric fields
* Key fields

Example:

```python
assert "BENE_ID" in df.columns
assert len(df) > 0
```

---

# 19. Step 3 — Standardization

Normalize:

* column names
* dates
* code formatting
* null values
* numeric types
* identifiers

Example:

```python
df.columns = (
    df.columns
      .str.lower()
      .str.strip()
)
```

Create canonical column names after inspecting the CMS source dictionaries.

---

# 20. Step 4 — Convert to Parquet

Create:

```text
data/processed/
├── carrier.parquet
├── outpatient.parquet
├── inpatient.parquet
├── beneficiaries.parquet
├── procedures.parquet
├── icd10.parquet
├── lcd.parquet
├── articles.parquet
└── ncd.parquet
```

---

# 21. Step 5 — Create Derived Tables

Create:

```text
data/derived/
├── procedure_stats.parquet
├── provider_procedure_stats.parquet
├── diagnosis_procedure_stats.parquet
├── pos_procedure_stats.parquet
├── peer_groups.parquet
└── ml_features.parquet
```

These tables should be much smaller than the raw claims.

---

# 22. Procedure Intelligence Dataset

Create:

## `procedure_stats`

Fields:

```text
procedure_code
code_system
claim_count
unique_beneficiaries
unique_providers
total_allowed
average_allowed
median_allowed
unique_diagnoses
unique_places_of_service
first_service_date
last_service_date
```

This table powers the basic Procedure Explorer.

---

# 23. Diagnosis/Procedure Intelligence

Create:

## `diagnosis_procedure_stats`

Fields:

```text
procedure_code
icd10_code
claim_count
beneficiary_count
provider_count
percentage_of_procedure_claims
```

This enables:

> "What diagnoses are most commonly associated with this procedure?"

---

# 24. Provider/Procedure Intelligence

Create:

## `provider_procedure_stats`

Fields:

```text
provider_id
procedure_code
claim_count
beneficiary_count
total_allowed
procedure_rate
```

Where possible, calculate rates rather than raw counts.

Example:

```text
procedure claims / relevant beneficiaries
```

This avoids simply identifying large providers as anomalous because they have more claims.

---

# 25. Peer Group Construction

Peer groups should be based on meaningful characteristics.

Potential dimensions:

```text
provider specialty
place of service
geography
provider type
procedure
```

Example:

```text
Orthopedic surgeons
+
same state
+
same procedure
+
same general place of service
```

Avoid defining peers solely by provider ID or raw volume.

---

# 26. Provider Anomaly Features

Create features such as:

```text
provider_procedure_volume
peer_procedure_volume
provider_procedure_rate
peer_procedure_rate
provider_to_peer_ratio
provider_diagnosis_procedure_rate
peer_diagnosis_procedure_rate
place_of_service_distribution
procedure_trend
unique_patient_count
```

Additional features:

```text
30_day_volume
90_day_volume
365_day_volume
```

where the data supports them.

---

# 27. Initial ML Approach

Do not begin with a complicated model.

Start with statistical/analytic measures.

### Example

```text
Provider procedure rate
        ÷
Peer median procedure rate
```

Then add:

* percentile
* standardized difference
* volume threshold
* persistence over time

Only after this works should you introduce an unsupervised ML model.

---

# 28. Isolation Forest

Use Isolation Forest as the first ML experiment.

Example feature set:

```text
procedure_rate
provider_to_peer_ratio
diagnosis_procedure_rate
place_of_service_rate
procedure_growth
unique_patient_count
```

Output:

```text
anomaly_score
anomaly_flag
```

The model should be treated as a prioritization mechanism—not proof of inappropriate behavior.

---

# 29. Anomaly Categories

Instead of one generic "anomaly" label, classify potential reasons.

Examples:

### Utilization anomaly

Provider uses procedure substantially more frequently than peers.

### Diagnosis anomaly

Procedure/diagnosis combination differs substantially from peers.

### Site-of-service anomaly

Distribution across places of service differs substantially from peers.

### Trend anomaly

Procedure volume changes unusually over time.

### Combination anomaly

Procedure appears unusually frequently with another procedure.

---

# 30. Coverage Intelligence

For each procedure, determine:

```text
NCD match
LCD match
Article match
ICD-10 relationship
coverage status
jurisdiction
effective date
```

The application should clearly distinguish:

> **"No matching policy found"**

from:

> **"Policy states that the service is not covered."**

Those are completely different conclusions.

---

# 31. Streamlit Application

## Main Navigation

Use:

```text
Procedure Explorer
Provider Investigation
Coverage Intelligence
AI Explanation
About / Methodology
```

---

# 32. Page 1 — Procedure Explorer

Input:

```text

```

Display:

### Procedure

* Code
* Code system
* Description

* Trend

### Clinical associations

* Top ICD-10 codes
* Diagnosis distribution

### Provider associations

* Top specialties

### Site of service

* Office
* Outpatient
* Inpatient
* Other

---

# 33. Page 2 — Provider Investigation

Inputs:

```text
Provider
Procedure
Time period
```

Display:

```text
Provider utilization
Peer utilization
Ratio
Percentile
Trend
Diagnosis distribution
Place-of-service distribution
```

Example:

```text
Provider rate       14.2
Peer median          3.7
Peer percentile      97th
```

Avoid presenting this as evidence of wrongdoing.

Use neutral language:

> **"Higher utilization relative to the selected peer group."**

---

# 34. Page 3 — Coverage Intelligence

Display:

```text
Medicare Coverage

NCD
LCD
Article

Relevant diagnosis relationships

Effective dates

Jurisdiction

Source document
```

Every policy claim should have a visible source.

---

# 35. Page 4 — AI Explanation

The LLM should not independently determine whether something is anomalous.

Instead:

```text
Python analytics
       ↓
Structured evidence
       ↓
LLM
       ↓
Natural-language explanation
```

Example prompt structure:

```text
You are explaining healthcare claims analytics.

Use only the evidence supplied below.

Do not infer medical necessity.
Do not make unsupported claims about fraud or improper billing.
Distinguish observed data from interpretation.

Claim/procedure information:
...

Provider statistics:
...

Peer statistics:
...

Coverage evidence:
...

Explain why this record was selected for investigation.
```

---

# 36. Evidence-First AI

The LLM should receive:

```text
ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE
+
CMS POLICY EVIDENCE
```

rather than raw claims.

Example:

```text
Provider procedure rate:
14.2 per 1,000

Peer median:
3.7 per 1,000

Provider percentile:
97

Relevant CMS Article:
Article XXXXX

Relevant ICD-10:
XXXXX
```

Then ask the LLM to explain the evidence.

---

# 37. AI Output Format

Use a structured response:

## Summary

One or two sentences.

## Observed patterns

Bullet list of measurable findings.

## Potential reasons for investigation

Bullet list.

## Coverage evidence

Relevant CMS policy.

## Limitations

Explain what the data cannot establish.

This is important for making the project credible.

---

# 38. What the AI Should NOT Say

Avoid outputs such as:

> "This provider is improperly billing."

or:

> "This claim should be denied."

Instead:

> "The provider's utilization is substantially higher than the selected peer group."

and:

> "This pattern may warrant review of the underlying claims and applicable coverage requirements."

The application should distinguish **anomaly detection from adjudication**.

---

# 39. Streamlit Performance Strategy

Do not perform expensive calculations every time the user clicks a button.

Precompute:

```text
procedure_stats
provider_procedure_stats
diagnosis_procedure_stats
peer_groups
ml_features
```

Then use Streamlit caching.

Example:

```python
@st.cache_data
def load_procedure_stats():
    return pd.read_parquet(
        "data/derived/procedure_stats.parquet"
    )
```

For resources:

```python
@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    return model
```

---

# 40. Local Development

Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Test locally before deploying.

Use a small sample first.

---

# 41. Streamlit Cloud Strategy

Do not deploy the complete raw CMS claims files.

The GitHub repository should contain:

```text
Python code
small derived datasets
requirements.txt
README
```

Large source files should remain outside GitHub.

Create a smaller demonstration dataset for the hosted application.

Example:

```text
demo_claims.parquet
demo_procedure_stats.parquet
demo_provider_stats.parquet
demo_coverage.parquet
```

The application should have a configuration setting:

```text
LOCAL_MODE
DEMO_MODE
```

---

# 42. Requirements

Initial `requirements.txt`:

```text
pandas
pyarrow
duckdb
scikit-learn
streamlit
plotly
requests
```

Add the chosen LLM SDK only when the AI component is implemented.

---

# 43. GitHub Strategy

Repository:

```text
cpt-hcpcs-intelligence
```

Do not commit:

```text
*.csv
*.zip
*.parquet
.env
API keys
large CMS files
```

Use `.gitignore`.

---

# 44. Configuration

Use environment variables for API keys.

Example:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Never put the key directly in:

```text
app.py
```

or GitHub.

For Streamlit deployment, use Streamlit Secrets.

---

# 45. Development Milestones

## Milestone 1 — Data Foundation

Goal:

> Successfully download, inspect and standardize CMS data.

Deliverables:

* Raw CMS files
* Data dictionary
* Source manifest
* Standardized Parquet files
* Data-quality report

### Local implementation status

The Milestone 1 pipeline is implemented in `src/pipeline.py` and runs with:

```bash
python -m src.pipeline --chunksize 50000
```

It validates the eight local beneficiary, inpatient, carrier, and outpatient sources; standardizes them in chunks; and writes Parquet files under `data/processed/`, `data/source_manifest.csv`, `data/data_dictionary.csv`, and `data/reports/data_quality_report.csv`. The manifest contains per-file CMS source URLs, SHA-256 hashes, download date `2026-09-28`, and release date `2023-05-30`; the dictionary links each field to its official CCW codebook. Raw data, Parquet outputs, and reports remain local and are excluded from Git. For a future run, provide verified dates with `--download-date YYYY-MM-DD --release-date YYYY-MM-DD`.

---

## Milestone 2 — Procedure Explorer

Goal:

> Select a CPT/HCPCS and understand its utilization.

Deliverables:

* Procedure lookup
* Claim volume
* Beneficiary volume
* Provider volume
* Diagnosis relationships
* Place-of-service distribution
* Utilization trend

### Local implementation status

The local explorer is built from observed HCPCS/CPT codes using:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m src.procedure_analytics
```

This writes `procedure_stats.parquet`, `diagnosis_procedure_stats.parquet`, `provider_procedure_stats.parquet`, `pos_procedure_stats.parquet`, and `procedure_trends.parquet` under `data/derived/`. The Streamlit explorer runs with `./.venv/bin/python -m streamlit run app.py` after Milestone 1 and these aggregates are built.

Claims are counted distinctly by claim type and claim ID. Diagnoses are multi-valued, so diagnosis percentages may sum above 100%. Provider rate means observed claims per beneficiary for that provider and code, not a population utilization rate. Allowed amounts and place of service are Carrier-only because those fields are not equivalent or consistently available in the institutional claims files. Codes are observed codes only; a complete HCPCS description reference has not been added yet.

---

## Milestone 3 — Coverage Intelligence

Goal:

> Connect procedures to CMS coverage information.

Deliverables:

* NCD relationships
* LCD relationships
* Article relationships
* ICD-10 relationships
* Policy dates
* Source links

### Local implementation status

Place `current_lcd.zip`, `current_article.zip`, and `ncd.zip` in `data/raw/coverage/`. Each archive contains a nested CSV bundle; the importer reads those bundles directly without extracting or modifying the raw archives. Build code-level relationships with:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m src.coverage_ingest
```

This writes `coverage_policy_matches.parquet`, `coverage_icd10_relationships.parquet`, and `coverage_ncd_relationships.parquet` under `data/derived/`, filtered to observed procedure codes in the Milestone 2 statistics. It joins LCD/Article HCPCS rows to exact current policy ID/version, attaches Article ICD-10 covered/noncovered code-table rows, and follows positive NCD references from matched documents. Placeholder NCD ID `0` is ignored. Coverage archives and generated tables are excluded from Git.

For codes present in the current LCD/Article code tables, the Coverage Intelligence panel displays `short_description` and `long_description` separately. The current CMS MCD bundles do not provide a medium-description field, so it remains blank. Codes without an LCD/Article relationship may still lack a description until a complete HCPCS reference is added.

The app can also refresh the public CMS Coverage API summary indexes for NCDs, final LCDs, and Articles; it caches them under `data/coverage_cache/` and supports title/ID search with official source links. Code-table relationships come from the local exports, not the summary index. An Article ICD-10 noncovered entry is an Article-specific diagnosis relationship, not a determination that the procedure itself is never covered. An absent relationship is not proof of noncoverage.

# 47. Success Criteria

The project is successful if a user can enter a CPT/HCPCS code and answer:

### Procedure

> What is this?

### Utilization

> How is it being used?

### Clinical

> What diagnoses are associated with it?

### Provider

> Who is using it?

### Peer

> Is a provider's utilization unusual relative to comparable providers?

### Coverage

> What CMS coverage information is associated with it?

### Evidence

> What specific data supports the finding?

### AI

> Can the system explain the finding in plain language without inventing facts?

# 48. Future Version — Denial Prediction

Once a real labeled denial dataset becomes available, add:

```text
claim
   ↓
procedure
diagnosis
provider
payer
place of service
policy
historical behavior
   ↓
ML model
   ↓
denial probability
```

Potential target:

```text
DENIED = 1
PAID = 0
```

Then evaluate:

* ROC-AUC
* PR-AUC
* precision
* recall
* calibration
* false-positive rate
* feature importance

The LLM should remain the **explanation layer**, not the prediction model.

---

# 49. Future Version — Prior Authorization Intelligence

The next logical product expansion is:

```text
Procedure
+
Diagnosis
+
Payer
+
Provider
+
Patient context
        ↓
PA risk
        ↓
Required documentation
        ↓
Relevant policy
        ↓
Pre-submission checklist
```

This could eventually become a separate application.

---

# 50. Future Version — Denial Prevention

The eventual architecture could become:

```text
                 CLAIM
                   |
       ┌───────────┼────────────┐
       |           |            |
   Procedure    Diagnosis    Provider
       |           |            |
       └───────────┼────────────┘
                   |
             Coverage Policy
                   |
             Historical Claims
                   |
             ML Risk Model
                   |
            Investigation
                   |
             Evidence Layer
                   |
                  LLM
                   |
          Actionable Explanation
```

# 51. Important Methodological Limitations

The application should clearly document that:

1. CMS synthetic claims are not representative of actual Medicare utilization.
2. Synthetic claims should not be used to make real-world population estimates.
3. An anomaly does not imply fraud, abuse, inappropriate care, or incorrect billing.
4. Absence of a matching CMS policy does not establish that a service is uncovered.
5. Coverage varies by payer and jurisdiction.
6. Medicare coverage information should not automatically be generalized to commercial health plans.
7. CPT data is subject to AMA licensing.
8. The initial POC does not predict actual claim denials.
9. Peer-group definitions materially affect anomaly results.
10. LLM-generated explanations must remain grounded in retrieved evidence.

---

# 52. Final Product Vision

The long-term product is not:

> **"A CPT lookup tool."**

It is:

> **A procedure intelligence layer that connects codes, claims, clinical context, provider behavior, coverage policy, and AI-generated explanations.**

The progression is:

```text
CPT/HCPCS
     ↓
Procedure Intelligence
     ↓
Coverage Intelligence
     ↓
Provider Intelligence
     ↓
Anomaly Intelligence
     ↓
AI Explanation
     ↓
Denial Prevention
     ↓
Prior Authorization Intelligence
```

The first version should remain deliberately narrow:

> **"Investigate a Procedure"**

That gives you a manageable personal project while establishing an architecture that can eventually support much more sophisticated healthcare claims analytics.
